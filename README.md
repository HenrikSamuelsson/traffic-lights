## Traffic Lights Project

This repository contains experiments with the nRF5340-DK,
starting with the Nordic blinky sample and evolving toward a traffic
light controller.

### Goals
- Learn Zephyr/NCS basics on nRF5340-DK
- Implement a simple traffic light state machine
- Explore embedded coding standards and testing setup
